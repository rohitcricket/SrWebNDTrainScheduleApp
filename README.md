# A Train Schedule App using JavaScript Promises and Angular.js

The application allows users to select a departure and arrival train station, and see a list of trains, times, and durations. The app uses Angular.js for front end, and 'promises' to deal with asynchronous behavior with http as well as location. Angular has an http promise services to do the api call. However, for location service, you have to create a 'defer' promise object to display your latitude and longitude.

N.B. Currently, the app is using a dummy api call and not the real api call to a public transportation api. This is because I am way late and am submitting the app to meet the deadline.
